- It appears to work perfectly without Lamport timestamps. I think this is due to the hieracy of ports, being used as the comparison. In that case, the lamport timestamps are only neccesary to fulfill the Liveliness Criterion
- The MutexNode passed around (known as "s") is not passed by pointer (what is that called? By object?). Changing this breaks the functionality.
